      The plot is about a boy wanting to chase his dreams and the several obstacles and lessons he faces along the way. Definitely a great book for starters, as the story itself teaches you a lot along the way. I would suggest keeping your brain open while reading this, as it's more like a lesson than a skim-through story. From a bird's-eye view, the story is pretty predictable (especially if you are into anime) — you may find it boring, but hey, for a book this old, that itself is impressive.  Would I recommend it? Yeah, definitely. The story itself is not very long, and you can actually finish it in one go. Overall, a good read.
