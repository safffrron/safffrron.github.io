  <div class="note-content">
    <p>
      So last 6 months was full of me receiving insights about
      research, phd applications, conferences and etc. and generally
      trying to understand where I fit into all of this. So when AACL
      2025 was announced, happening at our own campus and organized
      largely through our lab, there was no way I was going to miss
      the chance to volunteer. Getting to observe and work closely
      with researchers and organizers felt like an opportunity that
      does not come often.
    </p>

    <p>
      Preparations started months in advance. There were regular
      meetings, planning sessions, and constant coordination to make
      sure things would run smoothly. I did not attend every meeting,
      but I stayed updated and could see how much effort people like
      Sushma ma'am, Deepak sir, Gajanan sir and Dhiren sir were
      putting in to get everything right. Watching that process itself
      was a learning experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      The conference ran from December 19 to 24, right in the middle
      of winter break. I went home briefly and then came back to
      campus on the 19th, which turned out to be an adventure in
      itself. Flights were chaotic, accommodation was uncertain and
      things were generally messy. Somehow, everything worked out. At
      this point, the lab honestly feels more like home than my hostel
      room.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was initially assigned to the registration desk, but later
      moved to the tech team, handling audio, microphones, Zoom and
      cameras for oral presentations and talks. On the first day, I
      was completely lost. I picked up my volunteer tee and ID, and
      mostly followed Sharath around trying to understand what was
      going on. The day started with the opening ceremony and keynote
      in the main auditorium, after which we moved to Room 21 for oral
      presentations.
    </p>

    <p>
      That first day, I mostly observed. We had a detailed
      run-of-the-show sheet that helped keep things on track. There
      were some technical hiccups, but nothing major. Most of the
      time, I was just passing microphones around and making sure Zoom
      was running. Other rooms were not as lucky and faced serious
      audio and connectivity issues, so we were grateful ours went
      smoothly. Between sessions, there were coffee and lunch breaks.
      The food was surprisingly good, apparently from Gulmohar. I
      liked the atmosphere of people discussing work and interests
      with each other. I did not talk much myself, as I was unsure of
      what I would even say given how early I am in my research.
    </p>

    <p>
      Day 2 went much more smoothly. It was mostly me, Vijendra and
      Sharath handling Room 21. That day also included CFILT Day,
      where alumni gathered to remember Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya
      and share memories. The highlight was the cultural event and the
      gala dinner. The dinner was great, and I managed to talk to a
      few professors. I still wonder how many of those conversations
      will actually turn into email replies, but it was enjoyable
      nonetheless.
    </p>

    <p>
      Day 3 was rough. Only Sharath showed up early in the morning,
      and he had to handle three rooms alone. Sessions started late,
      and things were chaotic. I had assumed he would set things up
      and I would join later, but after seeing how bad it got, I made
      it a point to come early for the remaining days. The rest of the
      day went better, and we ended with the closing ceremony, award
      distribution and a photoshoot.
    </p>

    <p>
      The real volunteering challenge began after that. The next day
      had eleven parallel workshops, each needing tech support. By
      then, my intern phase was over and I was assigned to handle an
      entire room on my own. My room, Room 14, had delayed setup,
      microphone issues and general confusion. Thankfully, the
      workshop presenters were understanding. Attendance was not very
      high, but we managed to complete the sessions without major
      issues.
    </p>

    <p>
      By Day 4 evening, we were exhausted. Me, Vijendra, and Sharath
      went to Versova beach to unwind and later visited a cat cafe. It
      was a much needed break and one of the nicest moments of the
      week.
    </p>

    <p>
      Day 5 was easily the best. I deliberately chose to be in Room 21
      because Prof. Ashutosh Modi was running a workshop there. He is
      the reason I got into research and was my professor at IIT
      Kanpur. To my surprise, he remembered me. I spent most of the
      day with his students, who were all extremely sharp and we even
      discussed a potential project together. I knew Prof. Modi was
      chill, but this was on another level. I did have a small moment
      of regret about not staying back at IIT Kanpur, but that is
      life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, volunteering at AACL was an intense but rewarding
      experience. From waking up at 6 in the morning to working late
      into the night, I got to see a conference from an organizer's
      perspective. The academic exposure was great, but the networking
      and informal conversations were the real highlight. By the final
      day, I had spoken to students from different countries and
      learned how similar and different research culture can be across
      places. Next time, I would like to be on the other side of the
      conference as an attendee. This was fun and a great experience.
      Kudos to the entire team.

  <div class="note-title">Book this week #1 - The Alchemist</div>
  <div class="note-date">Paul Cohelo · December 2025</div>
  <div class="note-content">
    <p>
      The Alchemist is about a boy who wants to follow his dreams and
      the different obstacles, experiences, and lessons he encounters
      along the way. The story is straightforward and easy to follow,
      and most of its ideas are conveyed through simple events rather
      than complex plot twists.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think this book works especially well as a starter read. It
      doesn't demand much from the reader in terms of attention or
      background, and the lessons are communicated clearly. In many
      places, the book feels less like a story meant to surprise you
      and more like a lesson you're supposed to reflect on while
      reading. Because of this, it helps to keep an open mind rather
      than treating it as something to rush through.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a broader view, the story is fairly predictable,
      particularly if you are familiar with similar themes in anime or
      other coming-of-age narratives. This can make parts of the book
      feel slow or unexciting. Still, considering how old the book is,
      that predictability is not too surprising and doesn't completely
      take away from the experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing I liked is that the book is short and well-paced. You
      can finish it in one sitting without feeling tired or
      overwhelmed. Even if the ideas are not entirely new, the book
      presents them in a calm and readable way. Overall, I would
      recommend The Alchemist. It's not a deep or complex book, but
      it's an easy and thoughtful read that can be enjoyable,
      especially if you're just getting into reading.
    </p>

    <p></p>
    <p>Here are some quotes I liked from the book:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes
        life interesting."
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "If you start out by promising what you don't even have yet,
        you'll lose your desire to work towards getting it."
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "I weep for Narcissus, but I never noticed that Narcissus was
        beautiful. I weep because, each time he knelt beside my banks,
        I could see, in the depths of his eyes, my own beauty
        reflected."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
