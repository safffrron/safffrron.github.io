Definitely a great book for starters, as the story itself teaches you a lot along the way. I would suggest keeping your brain open while reading this, as it's more like a lesson than a skim-through story. From a bird's-eye view, the story is pretty predictable (especially if you are into anime) — you may find it boring, but hey, for a book this old, that itself is impressive. Would I recommend it? Yeah, definitely. The story itself is not very long, and you can actually finish it in one go. Overall, a good read. ★★★★★★☆☆☆☆ (6/10) ","permalink":"uildDrafts/hobbies/books/","summary":"","title":"Blog and Reviews"},{"content":" IIT Bombay : Semester 1 CS772 : Deep Learning for Natural
